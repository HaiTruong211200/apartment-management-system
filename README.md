## üîê Auth API (Node.js / Express / PostgreSQL)

Backend located in `server/` provides registration & login using bcrypt + JWT.

### Endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/register` body: `{ email, password, fullName }`
- `POST /api/auth/login` body: `{ email, password }`
- `GET /api/auth/me` header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### Quick Start

1. Create database (default name `ams`).
2. Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` and adjust secrets.
3. Install deps:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Server runs on `http://localhost:4000`.

### Security Notes

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (configurable rounds via `BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS`).
- JWT signed with HS256; rotate & store `JWT_SECRET` securely.
- Use HTTPS + secure cookie (if moving token to cookie in future).
- Apply role-based authorization with provided middleware scaffold.
